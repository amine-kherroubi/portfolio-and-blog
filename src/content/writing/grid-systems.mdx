# Grid Systems Explained

Mathematics and psychology behind effective layouts.

## What is a Grid System?

A grid system is a structure of invisible lines that helps organize content on a page. It's the foundation of most professional design work.

## The Mathematics

Most grid systems are based on mathematical ratios:

- The Golden Ratio (1.618)
- Rule of Thirds
- Fibonacci Sequence

These create naturally pleasing proportions.

## Why Grids Work

Grids work because they:

1. Create visual consistency
2. Establish hierarchy
3. Guide the eye naturally
4. Make responsive design easier

## Modern Implementation

In web design, we use grid systems like:

- 12-column grids
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap/Tailwind grid utilities

## Conclusion

Understanding grid systems is fundamental to creating professional, polished designs that users find intuitive and pleasant to use.
