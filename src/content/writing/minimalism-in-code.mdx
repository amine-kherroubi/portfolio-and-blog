# Minimalism in Code

Writing cleaner software through deliberate simplicity.

## Less is More

The principles of minimalism apply beautifully to software development. Just as
minimalist design removes unnecessary elements, minimalist code removes
unnecessary complexity.

## Simple Examples

Here's a simple Python function that demonstrates minimalist thinking:

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item.price for item in items)
```

Instead of verbose loops and temporary variables, we use concise comprehensions.

## The Benefits

Minimalist code is:

- Easier to read
- Easier to test
- Less prone to bugs
- More maintainable

## Conclusion

By focusing on essential functionality and removing everything else, we create
software that's both elegant and effective.
