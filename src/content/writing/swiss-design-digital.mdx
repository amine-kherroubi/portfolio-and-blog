# Swiss Design in Digital Age

Adapting timeless principles to modern interfaces.

## The Foundation

Swiss design, also known as International Typographic Style, emerged in
Switzerland in the 1950s. Its principles of clarity, readability, and
objectivity remain remarkably relevant in today's digital landscape.

## Core Principles

The movement emphasized several key concepts that translate beautifully to
modern web design:

- Grid-based layouts for consistency
- Sans-serif typography for legibility
- Asymmetrical layouts for dynamic visual interest
- Objective photography over illustration
- Minimal use of color

## Modern Applications

Today's designers can apply these principles through modern web technologies
while maintaining the essence of Swiss design philosophy.
