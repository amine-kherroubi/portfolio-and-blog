# Neural Networks Project

Deep learning architecture optimization for image classification.

## Overview

This project focused on developing efficient neural network architectures that maintain high accuracy while reducing computational requirements.

## Key Achievements

- 40% reduction in model size
- 95% accuracy maintained
- 3x faster inference time
- Successfully deployed on edge devices

## Technical Approach

Used PyTorch and TensorFlow to implement novel pruning techniques and architecture optimizations.

## Code Example

```python
class OptimizedNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.2),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layers(x)
```

## Results

The optimized architecture performed excellently on standard benchmarks while being significantly more efficient than baseline models.
