- Multiple algorithm modes
- Interactive parameter controls
- Export to high-resolution images
- Responsive to mouse/touch input

## Creative Approach

Blends Swiss design principles with contemporary generative art techniques,
creating a bridge between traditional typography and digital art.

## Reception
